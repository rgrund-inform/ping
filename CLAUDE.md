# Ping — Project Notes for Claude

Offline-first PWA for organising table-tennis tournaments. State lives on the user's device; an optional, self-hostable sync backend can mirror it across devices via a shared group code.

## Domain

Two tournament modes:

- **round-robin** — every player plays every other; winner has the most match wins (point diff is the tie-breaker).
- **knockout** — single-elimination bracket. Bracket size is the next power of 2; top seeds receive byes when the player count is odd.

A match score is a single set. The winning player reaches `tournament.maxScore` (configurable per-tournament; default **7**). The user records a result by tapping the **loser's** score under the player who lost — winner-side and loser-score are stored, the winner's score is implicit (`maxScore`).

A "fact engine" surfaces hype lines from local match history: head-to-head dominance, hot streaks today, most-played rivalry, closest rivalry, newcomer first-win, today's record. Facts are weighted; `factsAboutPlayers(facts, ids)` filters them so the **Next-match** screen prefers facts about the players in the upcoming match (falls back to general facts when nothing player-specific qualifies).

## Data model & persistence

`PingStore` (`src/types.ts`) is the entire app state — `{ version, players, tournaments, tombstones }`. It is the persisted JSON under `localStorage['ping.v1']`.

Schema **version 2** adds an optional `updatedAt` to every player, tournament and match, plus a `tombstones` list of deleted top-level entities (`{ kind, id, updatedAt }`). `updatedAt` is optional so pre-sync data stays valid: the store stamps it on every mutation and `src/lib/migrate.ts` backfills it on load (`createdAt`/`startedAt`/`playedAt`). Hydration runs the migrator via the persistence plugin's `afterHydrate` hook, so a v1 store migrates in place rather than appearing empty. **Bump `STORE_VERSION` and extend the migrator if the shape changes.**

A `Match` records winner-side + loser-score; the winner's score is always `tournament.maxScore`. Knockout matches additionally have `slot` (left-to-right position in their round) and may be `bye: true` (auto-advanced placeholder).

A `Tournament` carries `bracketLocked: true` once a knockout starts — round-robin tournaments stay editable.

Deleting a tournament or an unused player writes a tombstone (rather than only removing the entity) so the deletion propagates instead of being resurrected by the next sync pull. Matches are deleted with their tournament and need no tombstone.

## State store conventions

`useTournamentsStore()` exposes:

- `upsertPlayer(name)` — name-deduped (case-insensitive). Use this anywhere you accept a player name.
- `deletePlayer(id)` — refuses if the player has ever participated in a tournament (preserves history integrity).
- `createTournament(input)` → status `'setup'`. Does **not** generate matches.
- `startTournament(id)` — generates matches via `buildRoundRobinMatches` or `buildSeededBracket` and flips status to `'running'`. Knockout brackets lock here.
- `addPlayerToTournament` / `removePlayerFromTournament` — guarded: throws on locked knockouts; for running round-robins it calls `regenerateRoundRobin` so already-played matches are kept and only unplayed pairings are regenerated.
- `recordResult` — applies the result and, for knockout, auto-promotes the winner to the next round via `promoteWinner`. Also flips the tournament to `'completed'` when the final completes.

Mutations happen through these actions; do not mutate `state.tournaments` from a component directly.

Two additional actions serve sync: `syncSnapshot()` returns the full store as `{ players, tournaments, tombstones }` for pushing, and `applySyncBundle(bundle)` merges a pulled bundle with last-write-wins and returns whether local state changed (it is a no-op when nothing changed, so it cannot retrigger the mutation subscriber).

## Sync

Optional, opt-in, and additive — the app is fully functional without it.

- **Settings** live under localStorage key `ping.sync.v1` (`src/lib/sync/config.ts`): server URL, group code, cursor, last-synced time. The group code is the room secret and the bearer token; anyone with it shares a room.
- **Trigger points** (`src/stores/sync.ts`): app start, a debounced reschedule after every tournaments-store mutation, browser `online`, and returning to the tab. A manual "Sync now" lives in the settings view.
- **Protocol**: `pull(since=cursor)` → merge locally → `push(full snapshot)`. Merge is per-entity last-write-wins on `updatedAt`; a tombstone removes a live entity unless the live copy is newer, and a newer edit resurrects a tombstoned entity. See `src/lib/sync/merge.ts` (pure, unit-tested) and `src/lib/sync/engine.ts`.
- **Backend** (`server/`): plain Node 24, `node:http` + `node:sqlite`, no dependencies. Rooms are isolated by group code; each room has a monotonic `rev`. Tournaments are stored as JSON payloads *and* their matches are projected into a normalised `matches` table (kept in step, tombstoned when removed) so match data is durable and queryable at `GET /matches`.
- **Serving**: `server/index.js` serves the API and, when `STATIC_DIR` points at a build, the PWA from one process. The `Dockerfile` runs the API only; the PWA is deployed separately (e.g. GitHub Pages) and points back via `SYNC_URL`.

## UI conventions

- **Score entry (`ScoreEntryDialog.vue`):** two player cards side-by-side, a column of `0…maxScore-1` buttons under each. The user taps the score under the player who **lost**; that determines `winnerSide` and `loserScore`. The dialog confirms with `"<winner> beat <loser>: <maxScore>–<loserScore>"` before saving.
- **Hype facts:** put `<FactCard hype :prefer-players="ids" />` anywhere you want context-aware hype. With no `preferPlayers` it acts as a generic random fact.
- **Roster panel:** mode-aware. Round-robin: free add/remove with confirm dialog noting how many unplayed matches will be regenerated. Knockout: read-only after start.
- **Theme:** dark by default. The class `app-theme-dark` on `<html>` is set pre-paint by an inline script in `index.html` so there is no flash. The toggle in `App.vue` writes `localStorage['ping.theme']` only when the user explicitly toggles.
- **Routing:** hash mode (`#/...`). The Vite `base` is `/` locally and `/<repo>/` in CI (set from the `GITHUB_PAGES_BASE` env var that the workflow injects).

## Adding a new fact generator

Append a function to the `generators` array in `src/lib/facts.ts`. Each generator takes `(input, played)` and returns `Fact[]`. Always include `playerIds` so `factsAboutPlayers` can route the fact to the right "Next-match" hype context. Keep `weight` between 1 and 5 (higher = more likely to surface). Add a unit test covering at least one positive and one negative case.

## PWA

Manifest is generated by `vite-plugin-pwa` in `vite.config.ts`. Icons are SVGs (modern browsers accept SVG manifest icons). The install prompt is captured by `App.vue` via `beforeinstallprompt` and surfaced as an "Install" button. After first visit the app loads offline.

## Local dev

```bash
bun install                  # uses corp Artifactory via bunfig.toml
bun run dev                  # http://localhost:5173
bun test src/lib             # pure-module unit tests
bun run test:server          # sync-backend tests (node --test)
bun run start:server         # serve ./dist + the API on :8080
bun run build                # vue-tsc -b && vite build → dist/
bun run preview              # serve the built bundle locally
scripts/install-hooks.sh --worktree   # enable the pre-commit checks for this worktree
```

The pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs the frontend tests, a full
`vue-tsc` type-check and, when `server/` exists, the backend tests. It fails
closed when `bun` is missing.

Do **not** delete `bunfig.toml` or its corp registry URL — installs locally fail without it because the public registry is behind a TLS-intercepting proxy that doesn't include the npm root in the trust store. CI rewrites these files; locally they must remain.

## Testing

- Tests live next to the module: `src/lib/foo.ts` ↔ `src/lib/foo.test.ts`.
- The sync backend is tested separately with the built-in runner: `server/*.test.js` run under `node --test` (`bun run test:server`). Keep backend tests dependency-free.
- Use `bun:test` (`describe`, `test`, `expect`).
- Tests import siblings via **relative paths** (`'./schedule'`, `'../types'`), not via the `@/` alias — Bun's path-mapping discovery doesn't follow the project's tsconfig references.
- Tests are excluded from the production build (`tsconfig.app.json` excludes `*.test.ts`); only `bun test` runs them.

## CI / deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main`:

1. **verify** — sets up Bun, rewrites `bunfig.toml` to the public npm registry and `sed`-replaces the corp Artifactory tarball URLs in `bun.lock` (integrity hashes stay valid because the bytes are identical), runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun test src/lib`, then `bun run build` with `GITHUB_PAGES_BASE=/<repo>/` (validate only — the artifact is discarded).
2. **release** — runs `cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v4`. If the commits since the last tag warrant a release, it pushes a `chore(release): … [skip ci]` commit with the version bump and `CHANGELOG.md`, then cuts the tag + GitHub Release. Exposes `new_release_published` and `new_release_version`.
3. **deploy** — gated on `release.outputs.new_release_published == 'true'`. Builds the PWA and publishes the Pages artifact only when semantic-release just cut a new version.
4. **container** — gated the same way. Calls the reusable `.github/workflows/container.yml` with `new_release_version` to build and push the backend image, tagged `:<version>` and `:latest`. Non-release commits (`chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, …) build but never publish.

Permissions are per-job (`contents: read` for verify, `pages: write` + `id-token: write` for deploy, `contents: write` + `issues: write` + `pull-requests: write` for release, `packages: write` for container). Top-level is `permissions: {}` to deny by default.

Why deploy is gated this way and not on a tag-push trigger: tags pushed by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not retrigger workflows (GitHub's loop guard). Reading the release job's output and gating deploy in the same workflow run avoids needing a PAT.

## First-time GitHub setup

1. **Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions and reusable workflows.** New private repos sometimes need this turned on; if no workflow appears in the Actions tab after a push, this is almost always the reason.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions.**
3. If branch protection is enabled on `main`, ensure the GitHub Actions bot can push (semantic-release pushes the `chore(release)` commit). Either add a bypass for the bot or use a fine-grained PAT in `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Conventional Commits — required

Versioning, the changelog, and the GitHub Release are computed entirely from commit messages, so every commit to `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

**Format:** `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

| Type                                                              | Effect on version |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `feat:` (new feature)                                             | minor bump        |
| `fix:` (bug fix)                                                  | patch bump        |
| `perf:` (perf improvement)                                        | patch bump        |
| `feat!:` / `fix!:` / footer with `BREAKING CHANGE:`               | major bump        |
| `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:`, `build:` | no release        |

- Subject ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood ("add player stats", not "added player stats").
- Long detail goes in the body, separated by a blank line.
- Breaking changes go in a `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` footer or via the `!` shorthand.
- The `chore(release): … [skip ci]` commits are auto-generated by semantic-release. Don't write them by hand and don't squash them.

## Gotchas

- **`@/` alias works in Vite, not in Bun's test runner.** Use relative imports inside `src/lib/*.test.ts`.
- **`bun.lock` embeds tarball URLs.** It encodes wherever you resolved from. The CI rewrite fixes this for the public registry; if you swap mirrors locally, run `bun install` again to regenerate.
- **Knockout standard seeding** for size N: `seedOrder(8) === [1,8,4,5,2,7,3,6]`. Tests that assume specific R1 pairings must use this — round-1 pairs adjacent slots, so 4 players give `(1,4),(2,3)` not `(1,2),(3,4)`.
- **`pinia-plugin-persistedstate` 4.7.1** is mirrored on the corp Artifactory but its tarball 403s; the lockfile is pinned to **4.7.0** which works. Don't bump without testing the install through the mirror.
- **`vite-plugin-pwa` precaches the build output**, so a hard refresh after deploy is sometimes required to see new content immediately. The `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` config picks up the new SW on the next navigation.
- **`recordResult` is the only way to advance a knockout.** Don't write into a future-round match's `a`/`b` slots from a component — `promoteWinner` does that and handles bye-chains.
